# chromaBrowser
This is a simple browser for chromaDBs written in Python. Please feel free to modify it as much as you see fit. It had only one application for me so I didn't bother making it look nice. You can set font and font size for the data panes else there isn't much of presets. You may want to modify line 37 to set your default server though.
Hope this helps some of you.

BR, Mike
